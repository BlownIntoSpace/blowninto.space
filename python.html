  $$$$.split()                          Separates a single string into a list of the parts of the string
  "##{}##{}##".format(#1,#2)            Replaces the {} in the string with $1 and $2 in the order they are found

  " \n "                                Used within the string to use the escape sequence (New Line).
  " \t "                                Used within the string to insert a tab space.

~~~~~~~~ Lists ~~~~~~~~
  []                                    Square brackets are used to identify lists.
  [ #, #, #, #, #, #, ...]              Values in lists are separated by commas.

> List slicing is identical to that of strings.

  len([ #, #, ...])                     The length of a list can be found with the len() function.
  min([ #, #, ...])                     Returns the minimum value in the list.

  $$$$.insert(#1, #2)                   Inserts the element #2 in the index position #1.
  $$$$.append(#)                        Adds the element # to the end of the list.

  $$$$.reverse()                        Reverses the order of the elements in the list. Does not return a reversed list, but sorts the original list.




~~~~~~~~ Tuples ~~~~~~~~
> A tuple is an orders sequence of items of any types.

  ()                                    Parentheses are used to identify tuples. (Not necessarily needed)
  ( #, #, ...)        #, #, ...         Elements in a tuple are separated by commas.
  ( #, )              #,                One element tuples still require one comma.

  $$$$[#]                               Returns the element at position # in the tuple.

> Tuple slicing is identical to that of strings.

~~~~~~~~ Dictionaries ~~~~~~~~
> Dictionary keys must be unique and immutable.
> Dictionaries are nor ordered, and cannot be indexed.
> There is no predictable order to Key:Value pairs, and order may change when new items are added or removed.

  {}                                    Curly braces are used to identify Dictionaries.
  { $KEY$ : $VALUE$, ...}               Dictionaries are made up of Key:Value pairs. They Key/Values are separated by a ':'.
  $$$$[$KEY$] = $VALUE$                 Adding Key:Value pairs to the dictionary.
  $$$$[$KEY$]                           Returns the associated value in the Key:Value pair.

  len($$$$)                             Can be used to find the number of Key:Value pairs registered in the Dictionary.
  $KEY$ in $DICTIONARY$                 The 'in' operator can be used to find if a key is already in the dictionary.
  del $$$$[#]                           The del operator can be used to delete a Key:Value pair from the dictionary, where the key is #.

  $$$$.items()                          Access all Key:Value pairs as tuples.
  $$$$.keys()                           Access all Keys.
  $$$$.values()                         Access all Values.
> These methods can be used to create a for...in loop through a dictionary.

> In order to enable doctests, you need to include the following at the end of the code:
      import doctest
      doctest.testmod()

> Testing code is placed inside docstrings.
> The function to test is placed after a '>>> ' and the expected result is placed on the line below.

> The first two test cases will run without error, but the last one will be caught by the doctest.

  <BLANKLINE>                           Can be used to denote where a blank line should be placed in an output without the doctest thinking the testing is complete.
